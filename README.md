## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 
1. As as user, I would like to view the current weather forecast for today in my location and in other cities
2. As as user, I would like to see imagery relating to the type of weather
3. As as user, I would like to interact with elements in the site by either clicking with a mouse or by using a keyboard
4. As as user, I would like to learn about weather through snippets of information
5. As as user, I would like to test my knowledge through quiz questions and get feedback on the answer(s)
6. As as user, I would like to provide feedback to the site owner/developer, and for this to be acknowledged

### Site Objectives
1. To assist young children (ages 4-8) with learning about the weather 
2. To be responsive and functional
3. To meet all accessibility requirements, allowing anyone to use the site regardless of their abilities/needs
4. To display reasonably accurate data relating to the weather

### Design
- #### Strategy:
  Taking into account the intended website, I have:
  - Conducted research into similar sites, these will be listed in references.
  - Spoken with a primary school teacher to obtain their opinion on requirements for this age group. They have suggested that children of this age will respond well to; bright/vibrant visuals and interactive elements. Also Information should be concise and the site easy to use.<br>

  From research I believe there is an opportunity to make this website really stand out from the others in terms of the target market.<br>It seems that the majority of other sites tend to be very informative but not particularly eye-catching or engaging. <br>
  I also feel that younger children may be overwhelmed with the vast amount of information, large paragraphs and may lose interest.
  I intend to create a website that meets all of the expectations from the user stories, site objectives and takes into account findings from the research conducted. 

  The strategy is to create a website that meets all of the expectations from the user stories, site objectives and takes into account the findings from research conducted.
