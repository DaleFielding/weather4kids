# Weather 4 Kids
The purpose of this project is to create a website that assists young children with learning about the weather. The site will be intended to be interactive, fun, engaging and provide information in a way that is easier for younger children to understand.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 
1. As as user, I would like to view the current weather forecast for today in my location and in other cities
2. As as user, I would like to see imagery relating to the type of weather
3. As as user, I would like to interact with elements in the site by either clicking with a mouse or by using a keyboard
4. As as user, I would like to learn about weather through snippets of information
5. As as user, I would like to test my knowledge through quiz questions and get feedback on the answer(s)
6. As as user, I would like to provide feedback to the site owner/developer, and for this to be acknowledged

### Site Objectives
1. To assist young children (ages 4-7) with learning about the weather 
2. To be responsive and functional
3. To meet all accessibility requirements, allowing anyone to use the site regardless of their abilities/needs
4. To display reasonably accurate data relating to the weather

### Design
- #### __Strategy__
  Taking into account the intended website, I have:
  - Spoken with a primary school teacher to obtain their opinion on requirements for this age group. They have suggested that children of this age will respond well to; bright/vibrant visuals and interactive elements. Also Information should be concise and the site easy to use.<br>

  - Conducted research into similar sites:
    - [Weather wiz kids](https://www.weatherwizkids.com/) 
    - [Kids weather report](https://kidsweatherreport.com/report/bristol/c) 
    - [Climate kids - weather and climate ](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/) 
    - [DK findout - weather](https://www.dkfindout.com/uk/earth/weather/)<br>
   
    General findings from site research:
    - A couple of the sites display the actual weather through an API. One only provides for a fixed location (Indianapolis), the other shows this for the current location and also has an option to search other locations.
    - Colouring varies between sites. Most have opted for a white background with one or two colours. One site has multiple colours and a blue background.
    - They all contain imagery, some more than others.
    - Kid style fonts are generally used for headings.
    - They all display a logo at the top of the page. 
    - Navigation is towards the top of the page.
    - Footers generally have navigation.
 
  In summary, I believe there is an opportunity to make this website really stand out from the others in terms of the target market.<br>It seems that the majority of other sites tend to be very informative but not overly eye-catching or engaging. I also feel that younger children may be overwhelmed with the vast amount of information displayed. <br>
    
  The strategy is to create a website that meets all of the expectations from the user stories, site objectives and takes into account findings from the research conducted.
